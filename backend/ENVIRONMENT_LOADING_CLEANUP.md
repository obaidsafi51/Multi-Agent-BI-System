# Environment Loading Cleanup

## Overview

Removed duplicate environment variable loading in test files to eliminate redundancy and potential confusion.

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Environment variables were being loaded twice in `backend/tests/test_database_pytest.py`:

1. Once in the `pytest_configure()` function (proper pytest hook)
2. Once at module import time (redundant)

This duplication was unnecessary and could lead to:

- Confusion about when/how environment variables are loaded
- Potential race conditions or unexpected behavior
- Violation of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

## Solution Implemented

**Before (problematic):**

```python
# Load environment variables for tests
def pytest_configure():
    """Configure pytest with environment variables"""
    load_environment_variables()

# Load environment variables immediately when module is imported
load_environment_variables()  # ← REDUNDANT
```

**After (clean):**

```python
# Load environment variables for tests
def pytest_configure():
    """Configure pytest with environment variables"""
    load_environment_variables()
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Redundancy**: Environment variables are loaded only once
2. **Follows Best Practices**: Uses proper pytest configuration hook
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removes unnecessary duplication
4. **Better Maintainability**: Single point of environment loading for tests
5. **Prevents Confusion**: Clear understanding of when environment loading occurs

## Technical Details

- **`pytest_configure()`**: This is the proper pytest hook for test configuration
- **Module-level loading**: Was redundant and not following pytest best practices
- **Functionality preserved**: All tests continue to work exactly as before
- **Environment variables**: Still loaded correctly for all test execution

## Testing

- All existing tests continue to pass ✅
- Environment variables are loaded correctly ✅
- No breaking changes to functionality ✅
- Pytest configuration works as expected ✅

## Best Practices for Future Development

When setting up test environments:

✅ **DO:**

- Use `pytest_configure()` for pytest-specific configuration
- Load environment variables once in the appropriate hook
- Follow pytest conventions and best practices

❌ **DON'T:**

- Load environment variables multiple times
- Mix module-level initialization with pytest hooks
- Create redundant configuration calls

This cleanup ensures cleaner, more maintainable test code that follows Python and pytest best practices.
