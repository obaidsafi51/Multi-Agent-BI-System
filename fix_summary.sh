echo "üéØ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "   - 'what is the cashflow of 2024?' was using fast_path (incorrect)"
echo "   - Taking 7.95s instead of expected 1.2s for standard_path"
echo "   - NLP agent making direct HTTP calls to KIMI API instead of using MCP WebSocket"

echo "üîß FIXES IMPLEMENTED:"
echo ""
echo "1. QUERY CLASSIFIER FIXES:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Added specific data retrieval patterns"
echo "   ‚úÖ Modified simple patterns to only match definitions/formulas"  
echo "   ‚úÖ Updated complexity scoring to force data queries to standard_path"
echo "   ‚úÖ Adjusted thresholds: fast_path only for complexity ‚â§ 0.0"
echo ""

echo "2. MCP INTEGRATION IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Replaced direct KIMI API calls with MCP WebSocket LLM tools"
echo "   ‚úÖ Added _extract_intent_via_mcp() method"
echo "   ‚úÖ Added _extract_entities_via_mcp() method"
echo "   ‚úÖ Added _extract_ambiguities_via_mcp() method"
echo "   ‚úÖ Implemented proper fallback mechanisms"
