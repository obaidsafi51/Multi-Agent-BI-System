# Enhanced Workflow Orchestration Implementation Summary

## üéØ Implementation Overview

This implementation successfully replaces the Celery-based ACPOrchestrator with a WebSocket-native orchestration system that aligns with the future real-time communication architecture.

## üìã Completed Tasks

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Remove ACPOrchestrator from acp.py

- **Status**: Completed
- **Details**: Cleaned up `backend/communication/acp.py` by removing the entire Celery-based ACPOrchestrator class and related dependencies
- **Impact**: Eliminates architecture conflict between Celery task queues and WebSocket real-time communication

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Implement CircuitBreaker class

- **Status**: Completed
- **Details**: Created robust `CircuitBreaker` implementation in `backend/orchestration.py` with:
  - Configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts
  - Three-state management (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
  - Comprehensive statistics and monitoring
  - Thread-safe async operation
- **Impact**: Protects against cascading failures and service overload

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Enhance process_query with circuit breakers

- **Status**: Completed
- **Details**: Completely enhanced the `process_query` function in `backend/main.py`:
  - Added circuit breaker protection for all agent calls
  - Implemented proper error handling and fallbacks
  - Created protected wrapper functions with retry logic
  - Integrated comprehensive metrics collection
- **Impact**: Robust error handling and automatic service protection

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Add WebSocket progress updates

- **Status**: Completed
- **Details**: Implemented `WebSocketProgressReporter` class:
  - Real-time progress updates during query processing
  - Error reporting via WebSocket
  - Completion notifications with results
  - Enhanced WebSocket endpoint with metrics support
- **Impact**: Users receive live feedback during query processing

### ‚úÖ Task 5: Implement retry logic with backoff

- **Status**: Completed
- **Details**: Created sophisticated retry mechanism:
  - Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
  - Configurable retry policies per agent type
  - Proper exception handling and timeout management
  - Integrated with circuit breakers for comprehensive protection
- **Impact**: Handles transient failures gracefully without overwhelming services

nlp_agent_circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(
    failure_threshold=5,
    recovery_timeout=60.0,
    timeout=30.0,
    name="NLP_Agent"
)
```

### 2. Retry Configuration

```python
# Retry policies optimized for each agent type
nlp_retry_config = RetryConfig(
    max_attempts=3,
    base_delay=1.0,
    max_delay=30.0,
    retry_exceptions=(aiohttp.ClientError, asyncio.TimeoutError)
)
```

### 3. WebSocket Progress Reporter

```python
# Real-time progress updates
await progress_reporter.report_progress(
    query_id, "nlp_processing", "in_progress", 30.0
)
```

### 4. Orchestration Metrics

```python
# Comprehensive system monitoring
metrics = await orchestration_metrics.get_metrics()
```

## üîß API Endpoints

### New Monitoring Endpoints
