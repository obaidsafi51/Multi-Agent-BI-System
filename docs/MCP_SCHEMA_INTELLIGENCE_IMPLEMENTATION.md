```bash
# Health Check
✅ MCP server is healthy

# Database Discovery
✅ Discovered databases: 2
  - Agentic_BI (accessible)
  - Retail_Business_Agentic_AI (accessible)

# Query Execution
✅ Query executed successfully: 1 rows
  - Sample result: {'current_db': 'Retail_Business_Agentic_AI', 'version': '8.0.11-TiDB-v7.5.6-serverless'}

# Server Statistics
✅ Server stats retrieved: healthy
  - Cache hits: 0
```

### 2. Schema Intelligence Engine ✅

```bash
# Container Import Test
✅ Schema intelligence import successful

# Server Initialization
✅ "MCP tools initialized (database: True, llm: True, schema_intelligence: True)"

# Module Registration
✅ "All available MCP tools registered successfully"
```

### 3. Backend Architecture ✅

```python
# MCP Client Integration Pattern Successfully Implemented
@app.get("/api/schema/discovery")
async def get_schema_discovery():
    """MCP-driven schema discovery endpoint."""
    mcp_client = get_backend_mcp_client()
    result = await call_mcp_tool("discover_databases_tool", {})
    return {"databases": result, "source": "mcp_server"}

# This pattern is now implemented across all schema endpoints
```

### 4. Dynamic Schema Manager Integration ✅

```python
# Successfully Refactored to Use MCP Server
async def find_tables_for_metric(self, metric_name: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Find relevant tables using MCP server intelligence."""
    mcp_client = get_backend_mcp_client()

    # Primary: Use MCP server for business mappings
    mappings = await call_mcp_tool(
        "discover_business_mappings_tool",
        {"business_terms": [metric_name]}
    )

    # Integration successful - MCP server is primary source
```
