## Query Classification & MCP Integration Fix Summary

### ðŸŽ¯ Original Problem

The user reported that queries like "what is the cashflow of 2024?" were incorrectly being processed via `fast_path` when they should use `standard_path` because they require database access.

**Logs showed:**

```
Query classified as simple with fast_path (confidence: 0.95, score: 0.3)
Query processed via fast_path in 8.47s (estimated savings: 0.00s)
```

This was problematic because:

1. **Incorrect routing**: Data retrieval queries were using fast_path meant for definitions
2. **Poor performance**: 8.47s processing time instead of expected ~1.2s
3. **Wrong architecture**: Direct HTTP calls to KIMI API instead of MCP WebSocket

### ðŸ”§ Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Query Classifier Fixes (`query_classifier.py`)

- **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Added specific data retrieval patterns that force standard_path
- **Refined Simple Patterns**: Limited to pure definitions/formulas only
- **Updated Scoring Logic**: Data retrieval patterns add +2 complexity score
- **Adjusted Thresholds**: Fast path only for complexity â‰¤ 0.0 (pure informational queries)

#### 2. MCP Integration (`optimized_nlp_agent.py`)

- **Removed Direct API calls**: Replaced `kimi_client` calls with MCP WebSocket tools
- **Added MCP Methods**:
  - `_extract_intent_via_mcp()`
  - `_extract_entities_via_mcp()`
  - `_extract_ambiguities_via_mcp()`
- **Proper Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when MCP unavailable
- **WebSocket Architecture**: Uses `generate_text_tool` via WebSocket instead of HTTP

### âœ… Results Achieved

#### Query Classification Test Results:

```bash
âœ… "what is the cashflow of 2024?" â†’ standard_path (was fast_path)
âœ… "what is revenue?" â†’ fast_path (correct for definitions)
âœ… "show total profit last year" â†’ standard_path (correct for data)
```

#### Architecture Improvements:

- **Before**: Direct KIMI HTTP API calls taking 7.95s+
- **After**: MCP WebSocket LLM tools with proper fallback
- **Routing**: Data queries now correctly use standard_path
- **Performance**: Proper processing path selection

### ðŸŽ‰ Core Issue Resolution

**BEFORE:**

```
2025-09-13 18:41:55,979 - Query processed via fast_path in 8.47s
ProcessingPath.FAST_PATH path, cache_hit=False
```

**AFTER:**

```
2025-09-13 19:22:35,847 - Query classified as medium with standard_path
ProcessingPath.STANDARD_PATH path
```

The primary issue is **RESOLVED**:

- âœ… Cashflow queries no longer incorrectly use fast_path
- âœ… Data retrieval queries properly routed to standard_path
- âœ… Definition queries still use fast_path appropriately
- âœ… MCP WebSocket integration implemented with fallbacks

### ðŸ“‹ Files Modified

1. `/agents/nlp-agent/src/query_classifier.py` - Fixed classification logic
2. `/agents/nlp-agent/src/optimized_nlp_agent.py` - Added MCP integration
3. Container rebuilt and redeployed with changes

The system now correctly distinguishes between informational queries (definitions/formulas) that can use fast_path and data retrieval queries that require database access via standard_path.
