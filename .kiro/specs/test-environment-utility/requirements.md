# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses code duplication in the test suite by creating a shared utility function for loading environment variables from .env files. Currently, both `test_database_pytest.py` and `test_database_connection.py` contain nearly identical environment loading logic, which violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and makes maintenance more difficult.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized environment loading utility, so that I can eliminate code duplication across test files and ensure consistent environment setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test file needs to load environment variables THEN the system SHALL provide a shared utility function that can be imported and used
2. WHEN the utility function is called THEN the system SHALL load environment variables from the .env file located at the project root
3. WHEN the .env file exists THEN the system SHALL parse each line and set environment variables for non-comment, non-empty lines containing '='
4. WHEN the .env file does not exist THEN the system SHALL handle the absence gracefully without raising errors
5. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the system SHALL make them available to the current process via os.environ

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing test files to use the shared utility, so that the duplicated code is removed and maintenance is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shared utility is implemented THEN the system SHALL update `test_database_pytest.py` to use the shared function instead of its local implementation
2. WHEN the shared utility is implemented THEN the system SHALL update `test_database_connection.py` to use the shared function instead of its local implementation
3. WHEN the duplicated code is removed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality as before
4. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL continue to load environment variables correctly using the shared utility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the utility to be easily discoverable and well-documented, so that future test files can easily use it without duplicating environment loading logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the utility is created THEN the system SHALL place it in an appropriate location within the backend test structure
2. WHEN the utility function is defined THEN the system SHALL include clear docstring documentation explaining its purpose and usage
3. WHEN the utility is imported THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, intuitive API that requires minimal setup
4. WHEN new test files are created THEN developers SHALL be able to easily import and use the shared environment loading functionality
