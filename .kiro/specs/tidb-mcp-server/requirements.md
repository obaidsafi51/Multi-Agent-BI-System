# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides TiDB Cloud database context to Large Language Models. The server will expose database schema information, table structures, column types, and sample data to help LLMs generate optimal SQL queries. This enables AI agents to understand the database structure and create more accurate, efficient queries for business intelligence and data analysis tasks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to discover available databases and tables in TiDB Cloud, so that I can understand what data sources are available for querying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server receives a database discovery request THEN the system SHALL return a list of all accessible databases
2. WHEN the MCP server receives a table discovery request for a specific database THEN the system SHALL return all tables within that database
3. IF a database or table is inaccessible due to permissions THEN the system SHALL exclude it from the results without throwing an error
4. WHEN discovery operations are performed THEN the system SHALL cache results for 5 minutes to improve performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to retrieve detailed schema information for specific tables, so that I can understand the structure and generate appropriate SQL queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server receives a schema request for a table THEN the system SHALL return column names, data types, constraints, and indexes
2. WHEN retrieving schema information THEN the system SHALL include primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints
3. WHEN a table has indexes THEN the system SHALL return index information including column composition and index type
4. IF a requested table does not exist THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. WHEN schema information is requested THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to access sample data from tables, so that I can understand data patterns and generate more contextually appropriate queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server receives a sample data request THEN the system SHALL return up to 10 representative rows by default
2. WHEN requesting sample data THEN the system SHALL allow configurable row limits between 1 and 100 rows
3. WHEN sampling data THEN the system SHALL use TABLESAMPLE or LIMIT with ORDER BY for consistent results
4. IF a table is empty THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set with column headers
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL provide options to exclude or mask specific columns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to execute read-only queries against TiDB Cloud, so that I can validate query syntax and retrieve actual data for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server receives a SELECT query THEN the system SHALL execute it and return results
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL reject any non-SELECT statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DDL)
3. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL enforce a 30-second timeout limit
4. WHEN query results exceed 1000 rows THEN the system SHALL limit results and indicate truncation
5. IF a query has syntax errors THEN the system SHALL return the database error message to help with debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to follow the official MCP specification, so that it can integrate with any MCP-compatible client.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN the system SHALL implement the standard MCP protocol handshake
2. WHEN receiving MCP requests THEN the system SHALL respond with properly formatted MCP messages
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standard MCP error responses with appropriate error codes
4. WHEN the server provides capabilities THEN the system SHALL declare all supported MCP features in the capabilities response
5. WHEN handling MCP tools THEN the system SHALL implement proper tool discovery and execution patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure authentication and connection management, so that database access is properly controlled and monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to TiDB Cloud THEN the system SHALL use secure SSL/TLS connections
2. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support both username/password and API key authentication methods
3. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling with configurable limits
4. WHEN connections are idle THEN the system SHALL automatically close them after a configurable timeout
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor server performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server processes requests THEN the system SHALL log request details, execution time, and results
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log full error details including stack traces for debugging
3. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL log configuration details and connection status
4. WHEN handling high request volumes THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent database overload
5. WHEN logging sensitive information THEN the system SHALL mask credentials and personal data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable server settings, so that I can adapt the server to different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables or config files
2. WHEN configuring database connections THEN the system SHALL support multiple TiDB Cloud instances
3. WHEN setting performance parameters THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of timeouts, limits, and cache settings
4. WHEN deploying in different environments THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production configurations
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages about the configuration issues
