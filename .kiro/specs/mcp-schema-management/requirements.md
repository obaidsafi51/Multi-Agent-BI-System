# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature migrates the AGENT BI from static schema management (SQL files and migrations) to dynamic schema management using the existing TiDB MCP server. This will enable real-time schema discovery, eliminate the need for static schema files, and provide more flexible database operations through the MCP protocol. The system will leverage the existing tidb-mcp-server to dynamically discover and interact with database schemas instead of relying on hardcoded SQL schema definitions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to discover database schemas dynamically through the MCP server, so that I don't need to maintain static schema files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend service starts THEN the system SHALL connect to the TiDB MCP server to discover available schemas
2. WHEN schema information is needed THEN the system SHALL query the MCP server instead of reading static SQL files
3. WHEN database structure changes THEN the system SHALL automatically reflect those changes without code updates
4. IF the MCP server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement graceful fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN discovering schemas THEN the system SHALL cache schema information for 5 minutes to improve performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace static database migrations with MCP-based schema operations, so that schema changes are managed dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL use MCP server tools instead of migration scripts
2. WHEN creating tables THEN the system SHALL leverage MCP server's table creation capabilities
3. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL use real-time schema information from the MCP server
4. IF schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages from the MCP server
5. WHEN performing schema operations THEN the system SHALL log all operations for audit purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to integrate MCP client functionality into the existing database connection layer, so that all database operations use the MCP protocol.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL route them through the MCP client
2. WHEN the database connection manager initializes THEN the system SHALL establish MCP server connections
3. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL use MCP server's query execution tools
4. IF MCP operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL maintain both direct database and MCP server connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data validation service, I want to use real-time schema information for validation, so that validation rules stay synchronized with the actual database schema.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating data types THEN the system SHALL query current column types from the MCP server
2. WHEN checking constraints THEN the system SHALL use real-time constraint information from the database
3. WHEN validating relationships THEN the system SHALL discover foreign key relationships through the MCP server
4. IF schema information is stale THEN the system SHALL refresh it from the MCP server
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide context from the current schema state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to remove static schema files and migration scripts, so that the codebase is cleaner and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL no longer depend on schema.sql files
2. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL not require running migration scripts
3. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL validate schema compatibility through the MCP server
4. IF required tables don't exist THEN the system SHALL create them using MCP server tools
5. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL remove all static schema-related files

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to maintain backward compatibility during the migration, so that existing functionality continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing API endpoints and functionality
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL produce identical results to the static schema approach
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent error handling and messages
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL implement optimization strategies
5. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL pass all existing test suites without modification

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive configuration options for MCP integration, so that I can customize the behavior for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring MCP integration THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific MCP server endpoints
2. WHEN setting up connections THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of connection timeouts and retry policies
3. WHEN caching schema information THEN the system SHALL provide configurable cache TTL settings
4. IF MCP server authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support secure credential management
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of MCP operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing of the MCP integration, so that I can ensure reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing MCP integration THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all MCP client operations
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test against a real MCP server instance
3. WHEN performance testing THEN the system SHALL verify that MCP operations meet performance requirements
4. IF MCP server failures occur THEN the system SHALL test fallback and recovery mechanisms
5. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle schema changes, network failures, and timeout scenarios
