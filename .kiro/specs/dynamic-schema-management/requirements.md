# Dynamic Schema Management Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing dynamic schema management to replace static configurations in the AGENT BI system. The current system suffers from hardcoded table names, column mappings, and SQL templates that break when database schemas change. This feature will implement intelligent schema discovery, flexible query generation, and automatic configuration updates to eliminate static dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Schema Discovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agents to automatically discover database schemas, so that they don't break when table structures change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN all agents SHALL discover available databases, tables, and columns through the MCP server
2. WHEN schema information is needed THEN agents SHALL query the MCP server for real-time schema metadata instead of using hardcoded values
3. WHEN database structure changes THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and adapt to new table names, column names, and data types
4. WHEN schema discovery fails THEN the system SHALL implement graceful fallback mechanisms with cached schema information
5. WHEN discovering schemas THEN the system SHALL cache schema information for 5 minutes with automatic refresh capabilities

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Query Builder

**User Story:** As an NLP Agent, I want to generate SQL queries dynamically based on discovered schema, so that queries remain valid when database structure changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating SQL queries THEN the NLP Agent SHALL use real-time schema information to map business terms to actual table and column names
2. WHEN metric types are requested THEN the system SHALL dynamically find relevant tables and columns instead of using static mappings
3. WHEN time period queries are processed THEN the system SHALL discover available date columns and their formats automatically
4. WHEN aggregation is needed THEN the system SHALL identify numeric columns suitable for aggregation operations
5. WHEN query generation fails due to schema changes THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative tables or columns with similar semantic meaning

### Requirement 3: Flexible Metric-to-Table Mapping

**User Story:** As a Data Agent, I want to dynamically map financial metrics to database tables, so that the system adapts to schema changes without code updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing metric requests THEN the Data Agent SHALL use semantic matching to find appropriate tables and columns
2. WHEN multiple tables contain the same metric THEN the system SHALL provide options or select the most authoritative source
3. WHEN new tables are added THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in metric discovery without configuration changes
4. WHEN tables are renamed or moved THEN the system SHALL maintain metric availability through intelligent schema mapping
5. WHEN metric mapping is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide clarification options to users

### Requirement 4: Configuration Management System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to externalize all hardcoded values to environment variables and configuration files, so that the system can be reconfigured without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN all database connection strings, timeouts, and limits SHALL be configurable through environment variables
2. WHEN business rules change THEN metric definitions and mapping rules SHALL be updatable through configuration files
3. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production configurations
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages about configuration issues
5. WHEN configuration changes occur THEN the system SHALL support hot-reload capabilities for non-critical settings

### Requirement 5: Schema Change Detection

**User Story:** As a system monitor, I want to detect database schema changes automatically, so that the system can invalidate caches and update configurations proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database schemas change THEN the system SHALL detect modifications to table structures, column additions, or constraint changes
2. WHEN schema changes are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically invalidate relevant caches and refresh schema information
3. WHEN breaking changes occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide migration guidance
4. WHEN compatible changes happen THEN the system SHALL adapt automatically without manual intervention
5. WHEN monitoring schema changes THEN the system SHALL log all detected modifications for audit and troubleshooting purposes

### Requirement 6: Cache Management for Dynamic Schema

**User Story:** As a performance optimizer, I want intelligent caching of schema information, so that the system maintains good performance while staying synchronized with database changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching schema information THEN the system SHALL use TTL-based caching with automatic refresh before expiration
2. WHEN schema changes are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate affected cache entries
3. WHEN cache misses occur THEN the system SHALL fetch schema information from the MCP server and update caches
4. WHEN multiple agents need schema information THEN the system SHALL share cached schema data across all agents
5. WHEN cache becomes stale THEN the system SHALL implement cache warming strategies to maintain performance

### Requirement 7: Runtime Configuration Updates

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to update system configurations at runtime, so that I can adjust behavior without restarting services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL update business rules, metric mappings, and query templates without restart
2. WHEN new database sources are added THEN the system SHALL discover and integrate them dynamically
3. WHEN query performance needs tuning THEN timeout values and optimization settings SHALL be adjustable at runtime
4. WHEN configuration updates are applied THEN the system SHALL validate changes before activation and rollback on errors
5. WHEN configuration changes occur THEN the system SHALL notify all affected agents of the updates

### Requirement 8: Semantic Schema Understanding

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to understand the semantic meaning of database tables and columns, so that I can make intelligent mapping decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing schema THEN the system SHALL extract semantic information from table names, column names, and comments
2. WHEN mapping business terms THEN the system SHALL use similarity matching and semantic understanding to find relevant database objects
3. WHEN multiple options exist THEN the system SHALL rank them by semantic similarity and data characteristics
4. WHEN unknown terms are encountered THEN the system SHALL suggest the closest semantic matches from the discovered schema
5. WHEN schema documentation exists THEN the system SHALL incorporate table and column comments into semantic understanding

### Requirement 9: Agent Configuration Synchronization

**User Story:** As a multi-agent system, I want all agents to stay synchronized with the latest schema and configuration information, so that they work consistently together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema information updates THEN all agents SHALL receive notifications and refresh their cached information
2. WHEN configuration changes occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to all affected agents
3. WHEN new agents start THEN they SHALL automatically synchronize with the current schema and configuration state
4. WHEN agents become temporarily disconnected THEN they SHALL resynchronize upon reconnection
5. WHEN configuration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL implement conflict resolution strategies with administrative override options

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility During Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain all existing functionality during the migration to dynamic schema management, so that my workflows are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating to dynamic schema THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to work without changes
2. WHEN processing existing queries THEN the system SHALL produce identical results to the static schema approach
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent or better error messages compared to the static system
4. WHEN performance is measured THEN the dynamic system SHALL maintain or improve upon static system performance
5. WHEN rolling back is necessary THEN the system SHALL support graceful fallback to static schema management

### Requirement 11: Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring of the dynamic schema management system, so that I can ensure reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema discovery operations occur THEN the system SHALL log discovery times, success rates, and failure reasons
2. WHEN cache operations happen THEN the system SHALL track hit rates, miss rates, and cache effectiveness metrics
3. WHEN configuration updates occur THEN the system SHALL log all changes, who made them, and their impact
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and insights for troubleshooting
5. WHEN system health checks run THEN the system SHALL validate schema connectivity, cache health, and configuration integrity

### Requirement 12: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to ensure that dynamic schema management maintains proper security controls, so that database access remains secure and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing schema information THEN the system SHALL respect database permissions and only discover accessible objects
2. WHEN configuration updates occur THEN the system SHALL validate permissions and log all administrative actions
3. WHEN sensitive schema information exists THEN the system SHALL provide options to exclude or mask sensitive table and column names
4. WHEN audit logs are required THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs of all schema access and configuration changes
5. WHEN security policies change THEN the system SHALL adapt access controls without compromising functionality
