5. WHEN I ask similar queries THEN the system SHALL remember my preferred time periods and aggregation levels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CFO, I want to access core financial KPIs and metrics, so that I can monitor business performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query cash flow data THEN the system SHALL provide operating, investing, and financing cash flows with period comparisons
2. WHEN I ask about budget performance THEN the system SHALL show actual vs forecasted spending with variance analysis
3. WHEN I request profitability metrics THEN the system SHALL display gross and net profit margins with trend analysis
4. WHEN I inquire about investments THEN the system SHALL show ROI analysis with performance rankings
5. WHEN I ask about financial ratios THEN the system SHALL provide debt-to-equity, current ratio, and other key ratios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CFO, I want the system to handle intelligent time period processing, so that I can use natural language for date ranges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use terms like "quarterly" or "Q1" THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the appropriate quarter with year inference
2. WHEN I say "this year" or "YTD" THEN the system SHALL provide year-to-date data with same-period comparisons
3. WHEN I request "monthly" data THEN the system SHALL handle month-end adjustments and seasonal comparisons
4. WHEN I use relative terms like "last 6 months" THEN the system SHALL dynamically calculate the appropriate date range
5. WHEN time periods are incomplete THEN the system SHALL handle partial periods appropriately with clear indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a CFO, I want a split-screen interface with chat and dashboard, so that I can interact naturally while viewing visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the system THEN the Next.js interface SHALL display a chat area (30%) and dashboard area (70%)
2. WHEN I enter queries THEN the chat SHALL maintain conversation history with previous queries
3. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and progress updates using shadcn/ui components
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested corrections using shadcn/ui alert components
5. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL be responsive across different screen sizes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the multi-agent architecture with KIMI-powered NLP Agent to communicate effectively, so that the system provides reliable and coordinated responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the NLP Agent processes queries THEN it SHALL use KIMI LLM API for natural language understanding and intent extraction
2. WHEN agents need to communicate THEN the system SHALL use MCP for context sharing across agents
3. WHEN agents require direct communication THEN the system SHALL use A2A protocol for peer-to-peer messaging
4. WHEN orchestrating workflows THEN the system SHALL use ACP for high-level coordination
5. WHEN agent failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and fault tolerance
6. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL maintain context persistence across the entire workflow

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a CFO, I want the system to connect to TiDB database, so that I can access real financial data for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish secure connections to TiDB database
2. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL retrieve data with proper validation and quality checks
3. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL optimize query performance with appropriate indexing
4. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs for all database operations
5. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a CFO, I want the system to provide intelligent error handling and suggestions, so that I can successfully complete my queries even when initial attempts fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use unknown terminology THEN the system SHALL suggest similar known metrics using text similarity matching
2. WHEN my query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide ranked interpretation options based on context
3. WHEN data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL offer alternative timeframes or related information
